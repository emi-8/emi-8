Hi, I’m Emi 👋

I explore the intersections of AI, security, and language—learning through PortSwigger labs, CTFs, LLM evaluation, and NLP projects. I enjoy quietly mapping how systems behave beneath the surface—whether it's a chatbot, a web app, or a data pipeline.

Currently focused on:
- 🧠 LLM quality assurance and behavior analysis
- 🧩 Capture the Flag challenges and vulnerability labs (HTB, TryHackMe)
- 📊 Image and data annotation (QA, categorization, visual accuracy)
- 🗣️ NLP and prompt engineering fundamentals

Always learning. Occasionally accompanied by a cat named Kiki. 🐾
