Hi, Iâ€™m Emi ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a curious learner exploring ethical hacking, NLP, and how systems connect.
Right now Iâ€™m focusing on web security, bug bounty methodology, and natural language processingâ€”studying through platforms like PortSwigger and real-world CTFs.

ðŸ’¬ Favorite tools: Burp Suite, Kali Linux, VS Code, Python

ðŸ“š Currently working on:

PortSwigger Web Security Academy labs
NLP system development & language modeling basics
Occasional CTFs and bug bounty recon practice

Feel free to explore my repos or reach out!
